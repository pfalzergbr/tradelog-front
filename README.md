## [Tradelog](https://tradelog-app.herokuapp.com/) - Front-end
### Porftolio-project by Gabor Pfalzer

Front-end code for the Tradelog project. My first full stack web application for the portfolio site, built mainly for my own practice. Connects to a custom Node.js backend, [Tradelog API](https://github.com/pfalzergbr/tradelog-api).

### Frontend Stack
- React (Hooks)
- Redux (No toolkit)
- Sass (Scss)


The application is help retail traders on financial markets keep track of their trading activities, may there be Stocks, Forex, Options or Cryptocurrencies.
Traders can create separate accounts for different kind of trading, and add strategies to differentiate between different trading activities. The application summarises profits, losses, win percentages, average profits and losses by accounts, strategies. 

Since most trading platforms and brokers provide robust analytical tools and expensive real-time data, this is more a practice project than a viable product, although it could be very useful for self assessing strategies and building discipline for individual retail traders. Most major brokers provide APIs to connect applications like this to fetch data and make it way more useful, but since it is not meant to be a full fledged product, did not go down that avenue. 

Also explored using other financial API-s to fetch stock market data, was very keen on build in a Symbol search and populating company data. Unfortunately, restrictions on the free APIs don't actually make this possible, even on this scale.
